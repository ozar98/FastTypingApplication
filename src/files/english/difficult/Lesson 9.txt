10. Lack of the "Cultural Literacy" Assumed by the Text's Author
In the jargon of reading theorists, students do not have access to the cultural codes of the textâ€”background information, allusions, common knowledge that the author assumed that the reading audience would know. Knowledge of cultural codes is often essential to making meaning of the text (See Willingham, 2009, pp. 25-52, for a review of cognitive research on reading comprehension and background knowledge.) So significant is this cause that E. D. Hirsch has tried to create a national movement promoting "cultural literacy," lack of which he claims is a prime source of students' reading difficulties in college (Hirsch, 2006; Hirsch, 1988; Hirsch, Kett, and Trefil 1987).javelin sledge cockleshell asteroid raged coach revenge drinker connection engine
